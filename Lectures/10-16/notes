Redirection

Shell Rediretctions
    - available when executing command in your hsell
        - implemented with the close/ open / dup technique

        $ command <infile> outfile

        < infile : take input from file infile
        >outfile : send output to file outfile

    - examples
        $ sort < file.txt > sorted.txt

        - sort will read lines from file.txt instead of terminal
        - The output of sort will be saved in sorted.txt
            - not seen on screen

        - they read from stdin(0) and print to stdout(1)


File Descriptor Table
    - Each process has file decriptor Table
        -points to an entry in the open file table 
    - System wide open file table 
        - records mode of opened files
        - holds index into inode tale that has actual file name and location on disk


Duplicating File Descriptor
    - Do not change file descriptor table directly
    - dup() copies old fd to first available entry
    - dup2() copies old fd to new fd

    dup2(3, 2)
    close(3);

    *ALWAYS CLOSE AFTER DUPPING**


Summary of Steps in Child process
    1. Close FDs that are opened in parent and not needed in Child
    2. open(). Open a file(and save the file descriptor in fd)
    3. dup2(). Copy FD to the right place
    4. close(fd)
    5.
