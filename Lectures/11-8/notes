Threads: POSIX Condition

Tips
    - Mutext protects
        - the shared data and the state (predicate P)
    - The condition variable
        - lock the mutex before waiting
            - the mutex is unlocked automatically while waiting
            - automatically relock mutex when waking up

Typical Structure of using mutex and condition
 
    pthread_mutext_t mutex;
    pthread_cond_t cond;

    pthread_mutext_lock(&mutex);
    while(! predicate ) {
        pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
    }
    access_shared_resources();
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);


Signal vs broadcast
    - pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
        - sends signal to only wake up one Threads
    - pthread_cond_broadcast is used to wake up all threads
