Inter-Process Communication with Pipes

pipe()
    #include <unistd.h>
    int pipe(int pipefd[2]);

    - creates a one-way pipe( buffer to store byte stream)
    - Two FD's in pipefd
        - pipe[0] is reading - pipe[1] is for writing
    - returns 0 if succesful


Connecting two processes
    - parent creates  apipe and gets two FD (3 adn 4)
    - after fork() - the child has 3, 4 too
    - one process can write to FD 4, and the other can read from FD3
    - if the pipe for parent to read for child to write
        - parent close(4)
        -
